1 beef bung
    1/2 lb "old fashioned" oats
    4 tbsp butter
    1 large onion, chopped
    3 lbs lamb meat, in chunks
    1 lb beef liver, in large chunks
    1 tbsp allspice
    2.5 tbsp salt
    1 tbsp pepper
    1 tbsp mustard powder
    1 lb lard (suet would be better, if available)
    1 cup beer


    1  Rinse the beef bung thoroughly, inside and out. Soak in lukewarm water for at least 1 hour.
    
    2  Toast the oats on a cookie sheet in a 350F oven for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    
    3  Saute the onion in the butter until translucent, and allow to cool.
    
    4  Mix the spices, onion, lamb, liver, oats and lard in a large ziplock bag.
       Put in the freezer until quite cold (even stiff) but not frozen.
       
    5  Grind the meat mixture using a large die.
       If you donâ€™t have a grinder, chopping everything up into very small pieces
       might do the trick. Use less beer in the next stage if you go this route.
       
    6  Put the meat mixture in a Kitchen Aid on low setting for one minute.
       Add the beer, and mix on medium for one minute, until everything gets sticky.
       
    7  Cut the bung into three equal pieces. One will be closed at one end, open
       at the other, while the other two will be open at both ends. Sew one end
       of the two-ended pieces shut with a needle and (strong) thread.
       
    8  Stuff each bung bag with the meat mixture. Squeeze out all the air, but
       leave some slack in the bag so that the contents can expand. Sew each bag shut.
       
    9  Unless you have a big Burns Supper planned, you should probably put two of
       the haggises in the freezer at this point.
       
    10 Bring a large pot of water to a simmer, and add the haggis. Simmer gently
       for at least three hours.
       
    11 Serve ceremonially with tatties and neeps (mashed potatoes and turnips).
